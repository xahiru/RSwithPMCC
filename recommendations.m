%% "Programming Collective Intelligence - Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications" 
% by Toby Segaran (O'Reilly Media, ISBN-10: 0-596-52932-5)
%
% Have you ever wondered how Amazon came up with recommendations like 
% "customers who bought this item also bought..."? Collective Intelligence
% is at the core of Web 2.0 revolution. 
%
% This book is a great introduction to data mining techniques that as 
% applied by companies like Amazon. It actually gives functional code 
% examples that you can play with. The book uses Python for examples, so I 
% rewrote them in MATLAB. I didn't work on del.icio.us link recommender
% example, however - I could parse XML response returned by del.icio.us 
% API using xmlread. But perhaps it is easier to use the Python code in 
% the book to get the data in text file and import that into MATLAB.
%
% One word of caution - the result you get with my M-files may not be
% identical to those in the book, though they should be fairly close. I
% believe this is because of the rounding errors caused by difference in
% degree of precision between MATLAB and Python. If this is the case, it's
% not a big deal for our purpose here, because we don't need  precise
% numbers to get recommendations.

%% Chapter 2: Making Recommendations
%
% This chapter explains how Amazon-like recommendation engines work. The
% approach used here is called Collaborative Filtering. 

%% Create the movie review dataset 
% Page 8: Collaborative Filtering - Collecting Preferences
%
% Check out "prefs.xls", which contain the basic dataset we use in the
% following examples. It is a table of data listing movie critics, movies
% they reviewed, and their ratings. But the data can represent anything you 
% want - the algorithm won't care so long as the data is formatted in a 
% similar way. You can import data from the Excel file using the Import 
% Wizard, but here we run this section of the code to import data into 
% MATLAB Workspace.

newData = importdata('prefs.xls');

% For some XLS and other spreadsheet files, returned data are packed
% within an extra layer of structures.  Unpack them.
fields = fieldnames(newData.data);
newData.data = newData.data.(fields{1});
fields = fieldnames(newData.textdata);
newData.textdata = newData.textdata.(fields{1});

% Create new variables in the base workspace from those fields.
vars = fieldnames(newData);
for i = 1:length(vars)
    assignin('base', vars{i}, newData.(vars{i}));
end

% There are 7 movie critics:
% 'Lisa Rose', 'Gene Seymour', 'Michael Phillips', ...
%    'Claudia Puig', 'Mick LaSalle', 'Jack Matthiews', 'Toby'

critics = textdata(2:end,1);

% There are 6 movies:
% 'Lady in the Water', 'Snakes on a Plane', 'Just My Luck',...
%    'Superman Returns', 'The Night Listener', 'You, Me and Dupree'

movies = textdata(1,2:end);

% Data is a matrix of ratings by those critics (row) x movies (col)
%   [2.5 3.5 3.0 3.5 3.0 2.5;

%% Generate "Snakes by Dupree preference space" plot

% This section of the code plots the movie critics on a graph based on
% their ratings for two movies - "Snakes on the Plane" and "You, Me, and
% Dupree". This is a way to show visually the relative positions of the 
% people in "preference space". The graph is 2D, so we can only use two
% movies to position critics, but the preference space could be multi-
% dimensional to use data from more movies.

%
% Rather than recommending products based on similar people's preference,

% we need to modify the above algorithm to work item-centric rather than
% user-centric. In other words, rather than comparing people to people, we
% can compare item to item and find out how similar they are. We can do 
% this by transposing the preference data without modifying the code.

%% Building the Item Comparison Dataset
% Page 23: Item-Based Filtering - Building the Item Comparison Dataset
%
% The algorithm in getRecommendations.m uses user preference to generate
% recommendations. This will work in a small scale, but it will not be fast
% once we have a large number of users or items. Therefore, big websites
% like Amazon.com would not want to use this algorithm as it is. The
% technique we implemented so far is called "user-based collaborative
% filtering". More scalable technique is called "item-based collaborative
% filtering" and it precomputes the similarities among items, rather than
% users. The key advantage is comparison between items will not change as
% often as comparison between users, so it doesn't have to be real-time.
% Yet, once you have the precomputed preference data, you can use it to
% come up with recommendations very fast. This data has to be updated more
% frequently early on when you have a small user base, but less frequently
% as you grow your dataset.

%% User-Based or Item-Based Filtering?
%
% 
% * Item-based filtering is faster with large dataset.
% * Item-based filtering requires overhead of maintaining the item similarity
% table.
% * Item-based filtering is more accurate when the dataset is sparse. 
% * User-based filtering is simpler to implement.
% * User-based filtering is more appropriate with smaller in-memory datasets
% that changes very frequently.
% * User-based filtering can show people which other users have preferences
% similar to their own - good for community-based services link-sharing or 
% music recommendation sites.
